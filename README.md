# Stock-Prediction-using-RNN-LSTM
Stock Prediction using RNN , LTSM and Find correlation between various correlated data 
Stock Prediction is an extremely difficult task due to it's extreme volatility, non-linear nature of stocks. Stock prediction is dependant on many factors, among them an important that determines current stock price is stock price of all other companies in similar or dependant sectors. Therefore it is necessary to analyze the price behavior efficiently using correlated companies and it's historical stock price data. In this project, we are planning to train a deep-learning model to predict Stock Price of a company using it's historical Stock Price Data of other companies in the same sector using RNN LSTM
